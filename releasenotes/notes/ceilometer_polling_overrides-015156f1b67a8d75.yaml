upgrade:
  - |
    Please, beware that behavior for defining resulting content for ``pipeline.yaml``
    in Ceilometer has changed.
    Now, `_ceilometer_pipeline_yaml_overrides <https://opendev.org/openstack/openstack-ansible-os_ceilometer/src/commit/c97b49a22098b57520dceef9f236c7378dddfce1/vars/main.yml#L59-L150>`_
    is going to be applied to all environments which do not have ``ceilometer_pipeline_user_content``
    explicitly supplied.
    Prior behavior can be ensured by adding ``_ceilometer_pipeline_yaml_overrides: {}``
    to user_variables.yml.
fixes:
  - |
    Logic for applying enchanced pipelines for Ceilomter+Gnocchi has been fixed.
    Now sinks and tranformation overrides defined in pipeline.yaml will be
    populated with content when operator did not supply any custom content,
    instead of applying them on top of it.
